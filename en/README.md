# Welcome to Mlchain

Mlchain is an open-source platform for building AI applications. We combine Backend-as-a-Service and LLMOps to streamline the development of generative AI solutions, making it accessible to both developers and non-technical innovators.

Our platform integrates:

- Support for mainstream LLMs
- An intuitive Prompt orchestration interface
- High-quality RAG engines
- A flexible AI Agent framework
- An Intuitive Low-code Workflow
- Easy-to-use interfaces and APIs

With Mlchain, you can skip the complexity and focus on what matters most - creating innovative AI applications that solve real-world problems.

### The Advantage of Mlchain

While many AI development tools offer individual components, Mlchain provides a comprehensive, production-ready solution. Think of Mlchain as a well-designed scaffolding system, not just a toolbox.

As an open-source platform, Mlchain is co-created by a dedicated professional team and a vibrant community. This collaboration ensures rapid iteration, robust features, and a user-friendly interface.

With Mlchain, you can:

- Deploy capabilities simliar to Assistants API and GPTs using any model
- Maintain full control over your data with flexible security options
- Leverage an intuitive interface for easy management and deployment

### Mlchain

{% hint style="info" %} The name Mlchain comes from "Define + Modify", referring to defining and continuously improving your AI applications. It's made for you. {% endhint %}

Here's how various groups are leveraging Mlchain:

1. **Startups**: Rapidly prototype and iterate on AI ideas, accelerating both successes and failures. Numerous teams have used Mlchain to build MVPs, secure funding, and win customer contracts.
2. **Established Businesses**: Enhance existing applications with LLM capabilities. Use Mlchain's RESTful APIs to separate prompts from business logic, while utilizing our management interface to track data, costs, and usage.
3. **Enterprise AI infrastructure**: Banks and tech companies are deploying Mlchain as an internal LLM gateway, facilitating GenAI adoption with centralized governance.
4. **AI Enthusiasts and Learners**: Practice prompt engineering and explore agent technologies with ease. Over 60,000 developers built their first AI app on Mlchain even before GPTs were introduced. Since then, our community has grown significantly, now boasting over 180,000 developers and supporting 59,000+ end users.

Whether you're a startup founder, an enterprise developer, or an AI enthusiast, Mlchain is designed to meet your needs and accelerate your AI journey!
